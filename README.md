The Primary Objective of this project is to make a program where you can take a small sample size 5 minutes or less of audio from any person and make a similar sounding voice . 
This is not voice cloning they are similar not the same, they will use the baseline voice and the system will make its own modifications to make the similar sounding voice for example taking a baseline voice of 
Michael Vendetti to make a voice similar to Morgan Freeman. This will be called the observer class. When the project is completed we should be able to complete what is stated above to get contract to voice entire video 
games tv animations and more . This will not be shared to the everyday user.
The Secondary Objective is the one that will be used by the everyday user, we will offer voice cloning and every other service eleven labs offers . This is the public offering, we should be seen as a direct competitor.
